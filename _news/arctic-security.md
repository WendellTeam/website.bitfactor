Arctic Security is proud to announce a follow-on investment to the company’s series A round by notable private entrepreneurs and investors Mikko Kodisoja, Ilkka Paananen and Georg Ehrnrooth. The new investors’ expertise in global growth companies strengthens Arctic Security’s investor base which also includes original investor CapMan Growth. The additional funds will be used to accelerate the company’s international growth in the cyber security market.

Arctic Security, established in 2017, had a very successful first year of operation, launching Arctic Hub and Arctic Node products and achieving over Euro 2,000,000 of international sales. The company’s products harmonize and categorize cyber threat information from over 100 threat intelligence feeds and then match these indicators to the actual owners of the impacted assets. This automated and intelligent correlation of the threats creates actionable data which can be used by organizations both to protect themselves in real time and to reduce future risk. Together Arctic Hub and Node deliver unparalleled scalability in integrated cyber defense from individual enterprises to multinational corporations.

> “Enterprises are struggling with cyber threats and need automated solutions to integrate actionable cyber threat intelligence into their defenses. This investment will help us to bring our proven products available to a wider enterprise audience worldwide” says David Chartier CEO of Arctic Security.
