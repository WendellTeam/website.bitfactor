Arctic Security, a Finland based cyber security company, and Rugged Tooling, a company focusing on securing large scale communication networks, announce partnership to create integrated cyber security solutions that help organizations to reduce the time to detect and react to cyber threats.

The new partnership leverages the expertise of both companies. Rugged Tooling provides PreScope SE1 sensor for monitoring internet traffic at company level. The sensor uses the threat information provided by Arctic Security software product called Arctic Node. Whenever the sensor indicates malware URLs or criminal command and control servers in company traffic it sends a signal to Node that can alert the company cyber security officer immediately on the suspicious traffic. This new integrated solution offers companies and other entities an easy-to-use way to organize and utilize their knowledge of cyber threats and thus, increase their level of cyber security.

> "Our mission at Arctic Security is to get companies and authorities organized into a defense cell based network that spreads information on cyber threat intelligence in a timely and automated manner. Integrating sensors like PreScope in Arctic Node is the next logical step as now we can not only provide companies with the information on the threats they are facing but also offer them tools to get alerted on malicious internet traffic.", says David Chartier, CEO at Arctic Security.

> Petri Ylläsjärvi, CEO of Rugged Tooling added: “Our intelligent PreScope&reg; sensors make detection of threats and related data flows fast and easy. Their wide integration possibilities and adaptive filtering make them a perfect solution for feeding advanced Threat Intelligence platforms, such as the Arctic Node. Our joint offering will enable organizations to detect security risks in their entire network with a very attractive total cost of ownership model.”
