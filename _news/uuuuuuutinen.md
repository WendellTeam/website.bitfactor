  "On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who
  are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so
  blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are
  bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty
  through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from
  toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a
  free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents
  our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and
  every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of
  duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures
  have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always
  holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to
  secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse
  pains."
