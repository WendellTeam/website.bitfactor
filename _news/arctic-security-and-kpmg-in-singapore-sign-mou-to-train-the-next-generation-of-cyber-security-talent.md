Arctic Security and KPMG in Singapore have signed a one- year Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), with both parties agreeing to collaborate by using Arctic Security’s Arctic Hub Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) platform to train cyber security professionals on cyber threats detection and response in the KPMG cyber war gaming training lab.

Under the terms of the MOU, Arctic Security and KPMG in Singapore will collaborate using the Arctic Hub CTI Platform and the facilities at KPMG’s Cyber lab, along with KPMG’s expertise in digital forensics and incident response. This will give trainees an environment to simulate actionable threat intelligence and incidences.

Conducted by the KPMG Business School, the simulations and training will enable cyber security professionals to become better prepared for dealing with cyber incidents while developing a better understanding of the global cyber threat landscape. This will help to improve their organisation’s cyber security posture.

According to data from KPMG’s CEO Outlook 2018, almost half of CEOs polled in Singapore believe that cyber security was their biggest threat to growth over the next three years. They also believed that becoming a victim of cyber-attack is not a question of “if”, but “when”. While half of CEOs polled indicated they were prepared for a future cyber-attack – just 31 percent were confident of identifying a cyber threat.

> “Today’s cyber security landscape is evolving at an incredible speed and the requirement for cyber security talent pool is increasing rapidly. Through this collaboration with KPMG in Singapore, we hope to develop and nurture the next generation of cyber security talent, by providing them with appropriate training and knowledge. We look forward to extending customised collaborations with other institutions in Singapore in the near future,” said David Chartier, CEO, Arctic Security.

> Eddie Toh, Partner, Cyber security, KPMG in Singapore said, “We welcome this collaboration with Arctic Security. Using real-time data and scenarios for training conducted in our Cyber Lab will lend a sense of realism to the training and benefit professionals who are looking to strengthen their overall enterprise cyber defence strategy.”
