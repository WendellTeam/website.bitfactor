Arctic Security adds Akamai and Group-IB threat feed integrations in their cyber threat intelligence products

Arctic Security, a Finland based cyber security company, adds Akamai and Group-IB cyber threat feed integrations in their Arctic Hub and Arctic Node threat intelligence products.

Both Akamai and Group-IB operate world-wide and offer leading knowledge on the cyber threats around the world. In addition, Arctic Security continues to support plenty of other commercial threat feeds, such as Blueliv, Fitsec, OpenPhish, Team Cymru and Zone-h, as well as a range of open source threat feeds.

Threat feeds provide important input for Arctic Security customers who have a full control over which feeds they select to use and how. The feeds help both threat intelligence sharing organizations, such as commercial or national cyber security centers, as well as enterprises have a better understanding on the cyber threats around them. Arctic Hub harmonizes the threat data collected from multiple sources, maps it to the right customers and shares it automatically to be immediately actionable for the companies. The enterprises get to know exactly which cyber threats they are facing and which issues, such as vulnerable services, they need to fix.

> David Chartier, CEO at Arctic Security, comments: "With the recent additions of Akamai and Group-IB threat feeds we are happy to reach close to 100 feed integrations in our Arctic Hub and Arctic Node products. We feel it is important to have a big selection of feeds for our customers to choose from so that they can customize the best cyber threat intelligence for their needs."

> “Actionable and up-to-date threat intelligence is a backbone of successful cyber defense strategy. It enables companies to better prepare for the attacks in advance, keep up with evolving hackers’ tactics and tools and always be a few steps ahead. The expertise from our analysts, unique topology and threat actor centric approach to our research is exactly the value we are going to bring to Arctic’s customers under the new cooperation,” – highlights Nicholas Palmer, VP of International Business at Group-IB.

> Lars Engdahl, Akamai Regional Sales Manager adds: "Arctic Security brings specialist knowledge and expertise to threat intelligence. They can further customize the unique, high quality data feeds that Akamai provides from interacting with billions of client devices every day, as the world’s largest Content Delivery Network. This combination will help customers make improved security decisions based on the actionable data provided by Arctic Security”.
