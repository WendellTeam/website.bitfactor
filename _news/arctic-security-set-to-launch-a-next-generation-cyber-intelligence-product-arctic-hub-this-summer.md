  foundation of its predecessor AbuseSA and can be used to leveling the playing
  field against adversaries by becoming a hub of cyber threat intelligence. In
  short, the Arctic Hub collects and disseminates vital threat information that
  needs to be shared from the ones who know, to the ones that need to know.

Finnish cybersecurity company Arctic Security is launching a next generation product for organizations and authorities who process cyber threat information. The Arctic Hub is a completely new product built on the foundation of its predecessor AbuseSA and can be used to leveling the playing field against adversaries by becoming a hub of cyber threat intelligence. In short, the Arctic Hub collects and disseminates vital threat information that needs to be shared from the ones who know, to the ones that need to know. <br><br>The Arctic Hub has been designed with years of experience operating in nation-wide and nation-to-nation information sharing. The Arctic Hub helps to form Defense Cells, a group of actors designed to organize cyber defense for your interest groups for pro-active defense against internal and external cyber threat actors. Arctic Hub supports this mission by enabling automated intelligence sharing between the defenders, which means sharing information on network abuse, vulnerable services and Indicators of Compromise within the cell. In practice, a national CERT/CSIRT team would share intelligence with their stakeholders across the nation, a multinational ISP would work together with their international subsidiaries and an MSSP could do this to help their customers better. <br><br>Arctic Security’s R&D Manager Teemu Vaskivuo is looking forward to the future:

> "I am excited and happy about the product launch. Our R&D team has worked hard to reach this point and for Arctic Security, it is a major milestone. The Arctic Hub is a true next generation threat intelligence platform. We have designed it by using all the knowledge our team has gathered through its close collaboration with national actors over the years. I truly believe we have been able to bring something completely new to the table. Our work in R&D does not end here, as we are on our way building another product, Arctic Node, which will complement our offering for our national customers and their stakeholders in their national Defense Cells. In the future, our model will be applicable in Defense Cells of any size, between organizations and entities in different businesses and roles. I have full confidence in our mission and I look forward for the positive response to our product launch and to the introduction of our Defense Cell concept."
