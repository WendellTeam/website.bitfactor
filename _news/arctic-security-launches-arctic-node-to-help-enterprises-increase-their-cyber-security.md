Arctic Security, a Finland based cyber security company, launches Arctic Node software product that helps enterprises use threat intelligence to increase their cyber security.

Arctic Node completes the product family that also includes Arctic Hub software that is targeted for threat intelligence sharing organizations. Arctic Hub collects, harmonizes and disseminates threat intelligence from various sources. Furthermore, it automates getting the right customized information to the right audience in a timely manner.

Now, with Arctic Node enterprises can easily collect the relevant threat intelligence from their preferred sources, such as from a national or commercial cyber security center. They can also choose to use some of the close to 100 direct threat intelligence feed integrations that Arctic Node offers out-of-the-box. With Arctic Node the enterprise users are always in full control on which threat intelligence data they choose to use, without any technical dependency to Arctic Security.

Arctic Node can be directly integrated in the existing cyber security infrastructure that the enterprises have earlier invested in. This includes integrations to security sensors, security information and event management systems (SIEM), incident response platforms and ticketing. All of these tools are completing each other and with the added Arctic Node integration the continuously updated threat intelligence can be automatically at the use of the other security infrastructure. Companies will have more visibility on the cyber threats around them that helps increase the level of their cyber security.

> "I am proud of our R&D team who has been such devoted in designing Arctic Node to be easy to use and focus on the real user needs.Â  Arctic Node will respond to the growing need by enterprises to have a way to get a situational picture on the cyber threats they are facing. Also, we believe enterprises will appreciate it that they can leverage their earlier cyber security investments by easy integrations that Arctic Node offers.", said David Chartier, CEO.
