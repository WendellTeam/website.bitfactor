Cybersecurity incidents and new regulation are driving authorities and enterprises to invest more in threat intelligence sharing and collaboration. To support this effort Arctic Security and Surevine have integrated their solutions for swift and effective incident detection, response and prevention. Arctic Security’s products automate handling of threat data and indicators of compromise in order provide actionable information that is mapped to the impacted assets and their owners. Surevine’s Threatvine is a next generation cyber-security information sharing platform designed for secure cross-organizational collaboration and collaborative intelligence analysis. These new integrations allow Arctic Security users to automate sharing of the indicators and threat intelligence to Threatvine platform. Furthermore, Threatvine users will be able to publish analysis results as actionable indicators to Arctic Security’s platform for integration to customer’s processes and other security products.

> “I am glad to see our complementary products offerings working together to save time of our customers’ analysts and experts. Automation provides scale, speed and actionability and frees up time to do more analysis work. With freed up resources and secure means to collaborate the analysis work will be timelier and more effective and can be safely shared to serve a larger community as well.” says David Chartier CEO of Arctic Security.

> “Threatvine powers CiSP, the UK’s national platform for cyber security information sharing which enables the management of cyber-security incidents cross-sector. It is not enough for complementary products in this space to co-exist, solutions have to integrate so our customers can keep one step ahead of the threat. Together, we empower our users to do more and leverage the results of their analysis directly through security automation,” continues Stuart Murdoch, CEO and Founder of Surevine.
