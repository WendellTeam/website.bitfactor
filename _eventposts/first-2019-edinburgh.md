The Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) conference was held in Edinburgh on June 16-21, 2019. Arctic Security participated in the event as well with their stand. It was an exciting event: Our Solution Architect, Juha Haaga, gave a speech with the topic of "Distributed model for targeted threat intelligence - Cyber defense cells." Juha discussed the concept of a defense cell and how automation can manage the volumes of information sharing necessary in a national context.&nbsp;

In the same event, Harry W from the UK's National Cyber Security Centre, gave a presentation titled "The Challenges and Success of Notifying Victim Organisations at National Scale." We appreciated Harry W bringing this topic up. One of the main tasks of national CIRTS is to collect and share cyber-incident notifications. To turn raw threat data into actionable threat intelligence and share it with the right person at the right organizations at the earliest is NCSCs' principal responsibility. Automated feedback has the potential to solve this problem and provide data that is consistent. It will also significantly improve visibility into the local situation across all stakeholders. Overall, defense cells can help to organize cyber defense and produce great results.
