Our group of people from R&D, Solutions and Business teams and our CEO David Chartier flew out to sunny Kuala Lumpur at midsummer to participate in the 30th FIRST conference.&nbsp;

Normally, it is difficult to get Finns to travel during midsummer, since it is one of the most important public holidays and often marks the start of the summer vacation season. This time, however, the whole team was excited to make the the extra effort, since we had been working hard to be able to launch our next generation cyber threat intelligence platform the Arctic Hub at the conference.&nbsp;

Over the years, we have learned many things from our national level customers in Europe, North America and Asia and wanted to address these issues with the new product offering. For example, having the ability to collect and match tens of millions of indicators against thousands of stakeholder network assets and to disseminate targeted threat intelligence packages to each and every one of them in an automated fashion puts us in a unique position to serve our national and sector level customers better.&nbsp;

Having the ability to see the shared threat intelligence leveraged by the stakeholders in time and over time will also help drive decision making and understanding the actual risk facing the nations and critical infrastructure sectors, which our customers are tasked to protect.&nbsp;

The week flew by fast and the interest our new product generated was substantial. The team was kept busy talking to CSIRT teams from across the globe.

In addition, being a silver sponsor at the conference, we wanted to something special from Finland for the end-of-conference raffle. The raffle prize, which went out to an European national CERT team representative, was a bottle of award winning Finnish gin, Napue, as well as cool designer Iittala drinking glasses with the Arctic Security logo on them.&nbsp;

Since the team had so much fun in KL, you will definitely see us again in Edinburgh in 2019.
