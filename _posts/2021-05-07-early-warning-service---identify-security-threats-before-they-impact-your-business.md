Cyber criminals are already aware of the known weaknesses in networks, services, and devices. Wouldnâ€™t you want to be on the same page with them to stay protected? Early Warning Service (EWS) carries out early detection of the potential threats to a system, highlighting the scope for malicious behavior so that you can take appropriate corrective actions.

## **Threat Data Processing**

EWS service automatically collects and processes daily over 5 000 000 observations of cyber incidents and threats worldwide. Observations are collected from over 100 external sources. This information can be hard to come by, and having access to it can be costly. Responding timely to threats requires fully automated large-scale data collection, processing, and targeted incident notification.&nbsp;

## **Why use this many sources? &nbsp;**

Our service brings together data from multiple third-party data providers. Each of those providers provides information on specific cyber security issues, and data collecting methods vary between data providers. Overlapping between data sources is generally very low. Different collection methods and geographical locations result in unique data sets, so relying on just one data provider can not offer sufficient coverage. In addition, when a substantial amount of data of the same threat is reported from numerous sources, it strengthens the signal about the specific security issue.

## **Why should I be worried about compromised hosts?**

Compromised computers are often exploited for data and identity theft and provide ways for ransomware to enter your network. Missing just one compromised host can leave a backdoor that will allow cyber criminals to maintain their foothold within your organization.&nbsp;

Compromised hosts make your systems fragile to data breaches. According to [Ponemon's study](https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/RZAX14GX), the average cost of a data breach in 2020 was **$****3\.86 million**. The most common causes were malicious attacks (52%) followed by human error (23%) and system glitches (25%).&nbsp;

Time is your biggest enemy when it comes to compromised hosts and vulnerable systems. It is only a matter of time when someone exploits them. The key is to spot the problems early enough and fix them.

## **Why should I be worried about vulnerable and open services?**

Vulnerable and open services reported by the EWS may indicate a publicly accessible weak point in your network. For instance, these systems may be misconfigured, outdated, or otherwise vulnerable. Cyber criminals exploit vulnerable computers for data theft, ransomware attacks and use them as stepping stones to even further attacks. Breach prevention systems do not usually catch vulnerable services, and the communications with those services from the outside may appear as perfectly normal network traffic.

## **What information is relevant for me from the EWS point of view?&nbsp;**

Cyber security information collected by EWS contains compromised hosts and vulnerable and open services that can adversely affect your organization's security. This information is already out there in public, which cyber criminals know about. And so should you. We match all threat observations to the information we know about your organization. Whenever there is a match found, we notify you specifically on findings related to your networks.&nbsp;

## **Benefits of EWS**

Early Warning Service automatically finds unattended known security problems that put your organization in danger.&nbsp;

* Periodic notifications about your issues to help you to catch incidents that have passed through other security measures. EWS gives visibility of issues that could be leveraged to effect a breach.
* Helps you quickly recognize and prioritize risks and reduce time to discovery when the ready-to-use information is handed out to you
* Easy to set up and maintain: you tell your assets and start receiving information without complicated configuration or installation processes
* Centralized: Covers your whole network infrastructure and services, including those running in the cloud
* Adds an additional layer of protection that complements existing cybersecurity investments
* Incredibly affordable
