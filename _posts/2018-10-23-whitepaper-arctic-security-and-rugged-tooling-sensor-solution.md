Number of cyber threats grows as cyber criminals seek to gain financial benefits, for example from cryptocurrency mining malware. More and more malware sites are built each day. The threats cannot be prevented only with the help of user vigilance as certain malware bypasses user interaction completely.

Arctic Security and Rugged Tooling are developing together a solution that brings the cyber threat detection at the new level in enterprises. The co-developed solution includes Arctic Node threat intelligence product that has been integrated with Rugged Tooling cyber security sensor.

These two products work seamlessly together out-of-the-box and help monitor the internet traffic by detecting and alerting the user if traffic is pointing to any malware URL or criminal command and control server.
