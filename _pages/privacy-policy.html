          <p>We use CloudCannon, Google Fonts, YouTube, GitHub and GitHub Pages to host and deliver our website and related content to you. In order to work as efficient content delivery platforms they may collect and use information that web browsers expose automatically, such as the browser version, IP address, site specific cookies, device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the time of access and user&rsquo;s operating system. These services should collect only minimal information required to deliver the content and we don&rsquo;t use these services to collect any information for processing. Some of these services may provide you an option to register directly as their user to improve the user experience. If you have directly registered to any of these services we advise you to study their respective privacy policies.</p>
          <h3>SPAM protection</h3>
          <p>We use Google&rsquo;s reCAPTCHA for SPAM and abuse protection on our web forms. ReCAPTCHA aims to distinguish whether an input is made by a person or by automated processing. For this purpose reCAPTCHA collects and sends to Google information about user&rsquo;s IP-address, web browser and Google related cookies. Google's privacy policy can be found at <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>.</p>
          <h3>Analytics</h3>
          <p>We use Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager to collect information about our website visitors and their behaviour while on the website. We have configured these services to anonymize IP-addresses, and we have not enabled transaction ID or user ID tracking. Google provides means to opt-out from Google Analytics data collection at <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>.

When your relationship with us develops further your email address may be manually promoted to HubSpot service that we use for our customer relationship management (CRM).</p>
          <h2>Your rights as a data subject</h2>
          <p>You have the following rights according to GDPR regarding the processing of your personal data. You can exercise your rights by contacting us by email.</p>
          <p><strong>Right of access:</strong> You have the right to check at any time, what personal information we have stored about you.</p>
          <p><strong>Right to object:</strong> You have the right to object our processing of your personal data, if you think that our processing does not happen according to the GDPR or if you think we have no lawful basis for processing your data.</p>
          <p><strong>Right to erasure: </strong>You have the right to remove your personal data at any time.</p>
          <p><strong>Right to data portability:</strong> You have the right to request a machine-readable summary of your personal data from us, so that you can transfer them to another service provider.</p>
          <p><strong>Right to lodge a complaint:</strong> You have the right to complain to the supervisory authority if you think we are in violation of your rights, in violation of GDPR, or the Finnish law regarding personal data protection. The supervisory authority in this case is the Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman (Tietosuojavaltuutettu) in Finland.</p>
          <p><strong>Right to object to direct marketing:</strong> You have the right to object to using your personal data for direct marketing purposes.</p>
          <h2>Duration of processing</h2>
          <p>Analytic services we use for the visitor information retain data up to 26 months. Email addresses submitted by the users are retained until user unsubscribes. If a subscriber requests a permanent opt-out from any future marketing then opt-out address is retained until person in question requests to be removed from the opt-out list.</p>
          <h2>Data recipients</h2>
          <p>Visitor information is processed only by named employees of Arctic Security Ltd., who are responsible for developing and maintaining the website. Email addresses and subscriptions are processed by our sales and marketing personnel. Currently we employ no subcontractors or other third parties to process any personal information.</p>
          <h2>Data transfers outside of EU</h2>
          <p>Content delivery services utilize geographically distributed servers in order to deliver the content efficiently, making it difficult to determine the actual location where short lived visitor data automatically submitted by the web browsers is stored.</p>
          <p>External services used by us for content delivery, SPAM protection, analytics and marketing do collect and process data outside of EU. Where possible we have configured these services to anonymize collected IP-addresses. We use only service providers that comply to adequate level of data privacy as required by the GDPR and that are committed to follow relevant EU regulations.</p>
          <h2>Automated individual decision-making</h2>
          <p>Your personal data is not used for automated individual decision-making or profiling.</p>
          <h2>Data protection principles and measures</h2>
          <p>We don&rsquo;t collect or &nbsp;ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. We require a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) from all our employees who process personal information. We control and keep track of who has access to the services used to process the data. We use transport layer encryption (TLS) to protect your interaction with our website. We periodically review implementation of our website and the related services we rely on against this privacy policy.</p>
