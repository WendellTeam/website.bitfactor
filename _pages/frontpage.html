      <h2>Improve your cyber resilience</h2>
      <p class="large">Being part of a cyber threat intelligence network improves your cyber resilience. You are always up-to-date on what is going on around you. You know which problems you need to fix. You are aware of the known threats and can protect against them.</p>

        <h3>Get connected to cyber threat information</h3>
        <p>Internet is full of broken or compromised devices. They exist in homes, enterprises and governmental entities. There is a lot of information available about these problems. Lack of information is not the problem. You are not alone. You just need to get connected to the cyber authorities and organizations that produce and deliver the data.</p>

        <h3>Know what you need to fix</h3>
        <p>Problem is that there are known issues that are not fixed. And there are known threats that companies and officials do not protect themselves against. We help bring the essential cyber threat information from the ones who know to the ones who need to know. This way the problems can be fixed and the cyber resilience increased.</p>

        <h2>Get information fast with defense cells</h2>
        <p class="large">Our mission is to create defense cell based threat intelligence networks to enable fast and automated information sharing with the parties. We want to get both cyber security centers and other cyber officials connected with companies and help them share the critical threat information between each other.</p>

          <h3>Defense cell hub shares information</h3>
          <p>In the heart of a defense cell there is a hub that receives and shares the essential threat information. A hub can typically be a national computer emergency response team or a cyber security center. Or, in big organizations and companies one of the units can choose to act as a hub and deliver the information to the other units.</p>

          <h3>Defense cell nodes receive and use the information</h3>
          <p>The role of the nodes in the defense cell is to receive the critical cyber threat information and act accordingly. For example, companies that are providing critical infrastructure can protect against the cyber threats reported to them by a national cyber security center that acts as a hub in their defense cell.</p>
