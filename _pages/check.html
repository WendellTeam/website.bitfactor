          <h1>Check the security footprint of&nbsp; your organization</h1>
          <p>Get a report showing your organization's security posture. All you need is a list of your most important domains and optionally Internet facing IP-addresses to assess your exposure.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Cyber attacks are not victimless crimes. Each day we receive more than NNN notifications about Internet connected devices that have been hacked into and are now used to attack others. On an average day in MONTH 2020 there were MMM compromised enterprises and organizations potentially unaware of the fact that they are now stepping stones to further attacks. To make matters worse, in the same time frame we received ZZZ observations of vulnerable and exposed Internet facing services, leaving even more organisations prone to fall victims to the criminals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
          <p>We at Arctic Security got fed up with this. We have built products to help our customers to catch these observations and to alert the victims. We are now building a partner network of managed security service providers to offer victim notification service to their customers. We have made our security posture report free for you in order to make the Internet a safer place and to promote the victim notification service.</p>
          <p>The report contains actionable data that can be easily used to find and fix problems:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Overview of potentially compromised systems in your network</li>
            <li>List of vulnerable services that are exposed to the Internet</li>
            <li>List of open services that are exposed to the Internet that typically should not be</li>
            <li>Can be used as an external security assessment of your organization</li>
