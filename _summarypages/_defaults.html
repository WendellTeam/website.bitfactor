      <p class="editable">
        Our mission is to help you get organized in cyber defense through <a href="/#defense-cells">defense cells</a>. We want to get both governmental and commercial cyber security centers and other cyber officials connected with companies and organizations to share the critical threat intelligence between each other. The more threat intelligence is spread inside a<br />defense cell the more resilient the parties and eventually, the internet, become.

        <h3>Defense cell hub shares information</h3>
        <p>In the heart of a defense cell there is a hub that receives and shares the essential threat information. A hub can typically be a national computer emergency response team or a cyber security center. Or, in big organizations and companies one of the units can choose to act as a hub and deliver the information to the other units.</p>

        <h3>Defense cell nodes receive and use the information</h3>
        <p>The role of the nodes in the defense cell is to receive the critical cyber threat information and act accordingly. For example, companies that are providing critical infrastructure can protect against the cyber threats reported to them by a national cyber security center that acts as a hub in their defense cell.</p>
